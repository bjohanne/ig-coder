Docker Compose files for MariaDB and phpMyAdmin.

MariaDB/MySQL: Config files are included in /mysql. Additionally, /mysql contains the password for the root user. The user intended for database access can be found in dbInit/6_user_grants.sql.

phpMyAdmin: Accessible on port 3333 for viewing and editing the database.

The containers should be running in the background. To see status:
	docker-compose ps
or
	docker ps

To stop:
	docker-compose stop

To run:
	Foreground: docker-compose up
	Background: docker-compose up -d

To restart (alias in ~/.bashrc):
	dc-rebuild

SQL scripts in ./dbInit:
1_phpmyadmin.sql		Sets up pma-internal tables.
2_setup_mgmt_db.sql		Sets up the structure of the main application database.
3_populate_mgmt_db.sql	Adds known rows to fixed tables (member types, operation types and visibility levels).
4_procedures_and_triggers.sql	Adds stored procedures and triggers to the application database.
5_development_test_data.sql		Adds dummy User, Project and Document entities for development purposes.
6_user_grants.sql		Creates a user for database access and grants it privileges on the API procedures.
9_mysql_secure....sql	Some queries from the original MSI script for increased security.

Filenames are prefixed with a number to ensure they are run in the correct order.

Do not overwrite scripts with SQL exported from phpMyAdmin. They must be maintained manually.
