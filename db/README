Docker Compose files for MariaDB and phpMyAdmin.

MariaDB/MySQL: Config files are included in /mysql. Additionally, /mysql contains the passwords for the root user and a standard user of MariaDB ("user").

phpMyAdmin: Accessible on port 3333 for viewing and editing the database.

The containers should be running in the background. To see status:
	docker-compose ps
or
	docker ps

To stop:
	docker-compose stop

To run:
	Foreground: docker-compose up
	Background: docker-compose up -d

To restart (alias in ~/.bashrc):
	dc-rebuild

SQL scripts in ./dbInit:
1_phpmyadmin.sql	Sets up pma-internal tables.
2_setup_mgmt_db.sql	Sets up tables for the main application database.
3_populate_mgmt_db.sql	Adds known rows to fixed tables (member types, visibility levels etc.).
4_procedures_and_triggers.sql	Adds stored procedures and triggers to the application database.
9_mysql_secure....sql	Some queries from the original MSI script for increased security.

Filenames are prefixed with a number to ensure they are run in the correct order.

Do not overwrite scripts with phpMyAdmin exported SQL, as it does not yet support MySQL 8+ features and other edits have been made to them. These include but are not limited to:

1_phpmyadmin.sql:
	CREATE DATABASE phpmyadmin;
	USE phpmyadmin;

2_setup_mgmt_db.sql:
	CREATE DATABASE mgmt;
	USE mgmt;
